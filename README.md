# Who Owes Whom
The purpose of this app is to keep track of how much you owe and to who along with how much people owe you and who.

The second purpose to this app is so that I can have some practice with RESTful APIs.

## What I use
This application includes an Express RESTful API server with an AngularJS front end.

For the backend:
  - Express
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose
  - NodeJS

For the frontend:
  - AngularJS
  - Bootstrap

## Helpful links
Brad Traversy's tutorials helped me a lot while learning how to write this app.

Some of the functions he used has been deprecated and are no longer supported but it is still a great tutorial on understanding the concepts nonetheless.

## Usage
Simply clone/download and then run ***npm install***, then run ***npm app***.
